# library

First version of the Library project from The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum.

I tried to experiment with some additional filtering and sorting functionalities, which resulted in some messiness because several filters don't add up in an intuitive way yet.

Known issues
- Several post-edit counterintuitive behaviors, mostly concerning author editing
- Read button toggle doesn't update filtered UI
- In general filtered UI is not updated after editions unless some other filter is applied after the edition

To improve
- Include animations
- Automatatic links in title to Wikipedia article
- Reduce code by instatiating objects from the library arrayin the UI with each change and updating both the UI and the array in a more coherent way

Feel free to interact with the library and leave any comments. You can check it out at: https://tostimontes.github.io/library/
