# library

Second version of the Library project from The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum.

I tried to experiment with some additional filtering and sorting functionalities, which resulted in some messiness because several filters don't add up in an intuitive way with the script's first version.
I then rewrote the whole script again (you can see differences between script.js and script2.js), and by updating the whole UI after any interaction I achieved the filtering and sorting functionality in an intuitive way.

Known issues

To improve
